Need to get a handle on the dataset. 

I did create a simple NB classifier using only 'salary' and 'poi' features. The accuracy was 0.344827586207 :) only up from that!

I need a list of the features and maybe a distribution of values. Right, found
explore_enron_data.py. 
The set of possible features:
    salary
    to_messages
    deferral_payments
    total_payments
    exercised_stock_options
    bonus
    restricted_stock
    shared_receipt_with_poi
    restricted_stock_deferred
    total_stock_value
    expenses
    loan_advances
    from_messages
    other
    from_this_person_to_poi
    poi
    director_fees
    deferred_income
    long_term_incentive
    email_address
    from_poi_to_this_person
'NaN' is used as a null value. There are 146 people in the dataset. in general, 
we have money and email data. It is not clear to me what 
'shared_receipt_with_poi' means. That a person was on the same email thread?
 I created a features dict and looked at the raw data. Maybe I'll start with 
total money, and some email to/froms.
